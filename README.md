`NumberChain.py` is a python program that asks users how many numbers they would like, then prints out that many numbers. It then asks the user if they would like to keep counting. If yes, it then asks how many more numbers they would like and prints out said numbers. If no, the program quits. This continues until the uswer selects no.
